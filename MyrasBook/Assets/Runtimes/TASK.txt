Important task : 
 * implement the variable system. similar to the inventory, I should make sure that my variable system is solid 
    and easy to use for scalability. 
    
    note to self : I could do one class that handle and store those data into an easy to use dictionnary. 
    I gotta figure out how to load it as an adressable first.
